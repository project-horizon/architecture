1. Abstract

  The horizon platform is a runtime for flexible applications. The main goal
  of the horizon platform is to write innovative applications over language
  boundaries. The concepts used in the framework, runtime and compiler make
  it possible to write applications with dependencies to completely different
  library ecosystems wihtout any hassle for the developer.

3. Application

  An Application is a package exposing a function with the signature:

    main :: IO a

  For further details see ?package/package {6. Executable Package}?.


4. Packages

  See ?package/package?.


5. Runtime

  The runtime handles the execution of the application. If the application
  configures an update spot, the runtime will try to check for a new version.
  If there is a new version the updater downloads all available patches. The
  downloaded updates will be installed the next time the application starts.


  5.1. Execution

    During execution the runtime loads all components of the application and
    the components of the applications external dependencies. After loading the
    components the runtime sets up an execution environment for the application.


    5.1.1. Execution Environment

      The execution environment contains all symbols that are in scope inside
      the main module. The process of setting the execution environment up
      includes loading of external symbols into the scope of the main module.


  5.2. Updater

    The updater is a component inside the runtime that may be configured in an
    application. It can download updates from an update spot und patch the
    application.


    5.2.1. Update Spot

      An update spot provides updates (patches) for an application. Those
      patches may be incremental or complete.


    5.2.2. Incremental Patch

      An incremental patch changes only a few sections of the application.


    5.2.3. Complete Patch

      A complete patch replaces the whole application as is.
