1. Abstract

  This document describes the implementation details of interface files on the
  compilation target JavaScript. The implementation requires only a subset of
  JavaScript aka JSON to provide the necessary functionality.


2. Disclaimer

  The source code provided inside this document is written in a pseudo dialect
  of JavaScript. The source code is by no means intended to be interpreted or
  compiled in any way. It represents the mere structure of source code
  containing declarative definitions of module elements.


3. Layout

  The layout of an interface file contains two main sections. The meta section
  and the module register.

    {
      "meta":    ?3.1. Meta Section?,
      "modules": ?3.2. Module Register?
    }


  3.1. Meta Section

    The meta section contains information about the
    library itself and the libraries dependencies on other libraries.

      {
        "name": !The name of this library.!,
        "version": !The version of this library.!,
        "dependencies": ?3.1.1. Dependencies?
      }


    3.1.1. Dependencies

      This is a simple list of dependencies. The dependency definition must
      follow the constraints defined in section ?3.1.1.1. Dependency?.

        [ ?3.1.1.1. Dependency?, ... ]


      3.1.1.1. Dependency

        A dependency can be resolved over several mechanisms.

          * Resolver library
          * Embedded Library
