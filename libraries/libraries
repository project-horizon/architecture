1. Abstract

  The horizon platform needs a way to split up software in libraries. A library
  contains by that an interface to map the exposed modules to function registers
  and function names to functions in a binary blob.


2. Interface

  See ?libraries/interface?.


3. Binary Blob

  See ?libraries/binary_blob?.


4. Packaging

  A library is stored in the layout of ZIP.

  Folder Layout:

    zip-file/
      interface.json
      blobs/
        blob.lang

  "blob.lang" is a placeholder for the name of a specific binary blob. The
  extension ("lang" in the example) stands for the target platform. For example
  the JavaScript compilation target would be represented with a "js" extension.
