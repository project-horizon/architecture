1. Abstract

  Package resolution is an essential part of the horizon framework as it is done
  in a very abstract way. This makes it possible to integrate foreign libraries
  directly into the ecosystem of the horizon platform. The required interfaces
  and functionalities are described in this document.


2. Resolver Service

  A resolver service can resolve to a library from a simple name and version
  pair. By that the resolver service plays an important role during compilation.
  A resolver service must implement a RESTful Web Service providing the resolver
  API.
