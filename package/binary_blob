1. Abstract

  A binary blob is the code of all modules compiled for a specific platform.
  The binary blob itself must be obfuscated so that it is impossible to deduce
  any meaning of symbol names. That makes it necessary that a binary blob is
  delivered with an interface file. An interface file describes the structure
  of a binary blob.


2. Symbol Names

  Symbol names must be unique in the scope of the package. This is done to make
  it unnecessary for any resolution of the module inside the binary blob. The
  mapping of the unique symbol name to the fully qualified name of a function
  is defined in the interface file.


3. Function Register

  The function register guarantees access to all functions inside a package
  with the unique symbol name of the function.
