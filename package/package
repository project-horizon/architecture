1. Abstract

  On most platforms there are ways to split software into modular systems. In
  horizon there will be a way to distribute multiple modules as a package. A
  package can define dependencies on other packages that can be either resolved
  at compile or runtime.


2. Interface

  See ?package/interface?.


3. Binary Blob

  See ?package/binary_blob?.


4. Packaging

  A library is stored in the layout of ZIP.

  Folder Layout:

    zip-file/
      interface.json
      blobs/
        blob.lang

  "blob.lang" is a placeholder for the name of a specific binary blob. The
  extension ("lang" in the example) stands for the target platform. For example
  the JavaScript compilation target would be represented with a "js" extension.


5. Resolution

  See ?package/resolution?.
