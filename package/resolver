1. Abstract

  A library resolver is an abstract component inside the horizon framework. It
  resolves dependencies from meta information. There are different kinds of
  resolvers.


2. Resolver Service

  A resolver service can resolve to a library from a simple name and version
  pair. By that the resolver service plays an important role during compilation.
  A resolver service must implement a RESTful Web Service providing the resolver
  API.
